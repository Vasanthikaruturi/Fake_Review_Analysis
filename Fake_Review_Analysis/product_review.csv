New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple.",1441005757,221.251.166.219,1,31-08-2015

I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.

Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.

The video is clear and the mirror is fairly easy to install.  It has lots of features such as long battery life, motion sensor video mode, gps hook up (if you have your own) and plenty of options.  There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.  Overall though I am pretty pleased with this mirror and recommend that everyone have one if for nothing else other than an insurance policy.",1440901878,204.235.219.228,1,30-08-2015

That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness!

From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars.",1440735712,205.55.97.209,1,28-08-2015

All the instructions say is \\""Turn It On\\"".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",1440615789,200.17.229.32,1,27-08-2015

They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty.

My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.

They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone.

On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving.",1440187283,195.232.1.30,1,22-08-2015

With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.  And it's all because of how poor the actual sound quality is.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this speaker.",1440234571,203.115.6.26,0,22-08-2015

I am now also linking a Iphone 6 and it is so simple from any device.<br /><br />The volume that comes out of this little speaker box is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.  Great for listening to music on the beach on vacation.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery gives about 10 hours of playtime which I think is decent and the USB charger makes it really convenient!<br /><br />I use Skype a lot and the speaker is perfect for skype calls which means my whole family can talk to my relatives in the UK without having to sit around a computer.<br /><br />My favorite element of this speaker is the ease of use, it only has a few buttons making it super simple to use!<br /><br />I would recommend this product as a value for the price!

I actually bought it as a gift for my dad.  I thought he might like an MP3 player, but I didn't want to get an expensive one because I wasn't sure how much he would actually use it.  Fortunately I opened this one up to load some stuff for him and try it out a bit, but I'm not even sure I'm going to give it to him.  I'm 100% sure he will use it once and never pick it up again.

So it's more emergency, emergency than I really wanted, not even 1/8th recharge.  The other problem is that the button to turn on the flashlight is raised with no cover, and while in my purse while knocking around with other things, it turns on too easily and power is lost with the flashlight on.

And this program is about as far from �simple� as any software I�ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It�s �EZ Nav Route Wizard� is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it�s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that�s their way of giving it to you.  However, I�m baffled by why, if that�s what you�re after, you�re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says �Fly to Chicago�.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we�re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don�t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you�re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard � so much so that there�s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren�t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you�re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you�re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop�s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps�  make sure you�re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you�d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref�s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let�s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those � they�re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you�re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn�t do a good job at ANY of them.  You�re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I�m still looking.  If that�s what you�re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn�t apparently in this software team�s vocabulary.  And if you�re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I�ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I�ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

Again trying it on the laptop it didn't work, and I realized that I do occansionally have problems with my laptop not having enough power in the USB ports for newer devices, like my 10&#34; tablet.

On top of the device are play / pause, Volume Up and Volume Down buttons.<br /><br />Now the problem, which was pretty small, so I couldn't decide what to say here. The speaker automatically connects to the last paired device when turned on, and if you turn off the Bluetooth on a connected device, you have to restart the speaker to get the device back into pairing mode.

I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place.

Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(",1439833521,207.69.205.41,0,17-08-2015

I have a car camera in every vehicle our family owns and each camera is different based on what was available at the time.  I have only had one wreck.  It was at a four way stop and I stopped and was turning left.  The vehicle coming the opposite way was approaching his stop sign as I was going through.  He ran through his stop and hit my rear quarter panel.  Know what he said when the cop arrived.  He said I ran the stop sign.  You should have seen the look on the guys face when I told the officer that I had a car camera.  Case closed.<br /><br />Anyway.  I have learned to buy simple inexpensive car cameras.  I dont need GPS or G sensors.  I do not like G sensors because any vibration in the car or camera mount can alert the G sensor and it will lock the file.  If that happens enough then your sd car fills up with locked files that will not be overwritten like normal files.  That can stop all recording until you erase the locked files.  The description says the camera has a G sensor but it does not. Also, the LEDs for night driving are not automatic and there are only two LEDs. They have to be turned on manually.  Now if you have had cameras with the LEDs for night driving then you know they are pretty worthless because they do not shine enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front of the camera which is not helpfull for video at night.  Your headlights provide the illumination.  In my experience most of these cameras are ok at night but you will not be able to read words or license plates.<br /><br />The setup is easy on the camera and the instructions understandable.  I recorded a clip at 720x480 which is one less than the highest resolution the camera offers.  You judge for yourself.<br /><br />I do not know how long the camera will last but I will update if it stops working.  Also dont turn motion sensitivity on unless you need it.  With it off the camera operates like a normal car cam.  It turns on and starts recording when you start the car and then turns off a few seconds after you turn the ignition off.",1439374441,219.60.237.179,1,16-08-2015

This is one of the best chipsets in the business -- no Russian GLONASS or Chinese GPS support in this chipset. Later models are based on a different chipset that supports both US and Russian satellites. However this unit works great!<br /><br />Driver software supplied emulates a serial port allowing compatibility with a huge range of GPS software.<br /><br />It also supports the industry standard NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) command set for programming and additional functions can be invoked including the ZDA (1 pulse per second time signal). This also makes it useful for many purposes including serving as an accurate time source for many applications requiring time sync including Amateur radio JT65 and WSPR use.<br /><br />The package comes attractively boxed with all software on a mini CD ROM and adequate instructions plus some velcro and a suction cap to anchor down the lead in your application. I found that the driver was compatible with many 3rd party GPS programs supporting the NMEA protocol.<br /><br />LED flashes when sync is achieved, usually about 10 seconds after connecting to the computer.<br /><br />It does everything that I expect from a USB powered GPS unit.",1439256045,222.115.103.27,1,15-08-2015

If you use this for long cable runs or inside of a car you are asking for shorts. aluminum is very brittle and breaks very easily. solder won't stick to it so the ends can't be tinned. the only option is to crimp a connector but the wire can't move at all because it will eventually fray and break off at the crimp point,1439222276,194.112.122.223,0,11-08-2015

When I first got it I used the SD card included (and later a SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card). Updated firmware from website then installed it in the front as Blackvue suggested. Used the iphone to change features within the camera, which was a little of a hassle due to the password -claimed it was such and such in the papers that came with it, and it wasn't. I had to go online and find others that had the same issue and used the password they got in with. Took about an hour to finally get in. Not a big issue once I got in.<br /><br />Checked video, it was terrible. Figured it was the card and firmware update. Checked online and I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br />Contacted Blackuve and they said &#34;because you purchased from Amazon and you live in the US, we cannot and will not help you&#34; - cut short and dry; they said it ruder / more unprofessional.<br /><br />So I dealt with it, and waited for another firmware update thinking it would help. Updated SD card to the SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card) helped some, but not by too much.<br /><br />Moved the camera done some from the rear view mirror (closer to the dashboard) and it helped a little more. So at this time, it was in the middle of my windshield, but still in the middle. Video was okay, still couldn't see license plates and that is huge with me. (a lot of hit and runs here).<br /><br />Since purchase, it would stop working, out of the blue. I would always leave it plugged in (I *did not* use parking mode; and with my cars, the power cuts off after 10 minutes auto) and from time to time, after starting the car, the recording would not even start until the GPS would kick in, which meant it would not start for almost half my journey. At times, the GPS would kick in, and the record would never start. There were times it didn't record at all, but the recording light would flash. I would get home and there would be nothing recorded. I would check on the phone and I would see live view, but it was not filling up. That happened more than 7 times.<br /><br />It would restart itself randomly. Very annoying, especially when you thought it was recording. I would be in the car over an hour and it would just say &#34;Blackvue for your driving safety&#34; for the first time, after an hour of driving, so I missed all that time. :|<br /><br />It died February 19th, 2014. I had my son look at it and we worked on it together and got it back up and running. And yes, all that happened within 2 months.<br /><br />Again died 2 weeks later. Fixed.<br /><br />Got sick of it and purchased 2 GoPro's used the Blackvue in the back, which strangely, the video was great. I could actually see front license plates, but where I live, SC, front license plates aren't expected; so I only saw tourists or vanity plates.<br /><br />Blackvue died again a month and half later. Had my son look at it because I was sick of it. He said he didn't want to mess with it again, but I talked him into it because I needed it for speed/mph reporting. He said it was due to power. The cord wasn't connecting.<br /><br />Got it working again. Left it plugged in so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and only unplugged it if there were an emergency, which meant if I had to update the firmware, format the card (which you could do in the camera, but mine would not do that), change cards or get info, I couldn't do that.<br /><br />Two months after that, not even a full two months, the SD card function, that holds the card in and let it come out, the spring, broke, so I could not get the card to go in, and I almost couldn't get the damn thing to come out, I had to force it out. Asked my son once again to fix it.. he took a look and said it was not fixable because the way they had it put together inside. I told him he could keep it. He said he didn't want it - and this is a guy who will take anything for his electronics and he didn't want that. So I tossed it. I spent over $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any. I purchased it here and I'm in the US. That's a loop hole apparently because according to Miss Rudy Huxtable (that's a pun, she was rude as a donkey) I wasn't supposed to, or allowed to have it!<br />- Had to constantly check on firmware for it and install it to make sure the video was at least useable - still wasn't. When I'd update the firmware, it was a hit and miss because when you update, you have to delete the previous installment off the card by either formatting it again or just deleting it.<br />- the power cord is long enough for the back (standard vehicle) to the front *but* if you unplug it a lot, like once a week, it will wear out and not power up anymore, like mine did more than a few times.<br />- it lets you know the SD card isn't there even though, uh, it is.<br />- says it's recording, but it's not.<br />- says audio is starting even if you have it turned off via app or camera and aren't even touching it... even wondered if I had a ghost a few times in the car with me ...or bugs.<br />- wi-fi does the same; off.. on, off, on.. doesn't connect.<br />- gets hot even if it's not recording.<br />- video did better in the back BUT I had to get out to fix the plug unexpectedly a lot because of the power issue so it would go in and out of power and I'd be lucky when it would restart, if it would start recording because of THAT issue as well.<br />- other issues, but like I said, it's been over a year and my memory isn't great with this product because I HATED it.<br /><br />For that price, I would rather have a small person or a fairy sit in the back and take notes and hold a recorder. . . . that's why I turned around and got GoPro's.. (psssst. the $129 is *much* better than the more expensive ones.. I got the expensive one first and the cheaper later and it does *much* better than that!) I have the cheaper one in back and it picks up everything .. the expensive one in front.. I just need a dash cam to pick up speed/mph, GoPro's don't do that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like Blackvue, because it's wi-fi, speed and GPS but honestly, it's a piece of junk - at least here [on 'A'] it is.r $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any.

I've made the mistake of not pressing the volume buttons long enough, and it's annoying to have to skip or restart the song. But those are just nit-picky.

You really have to look at the speaker in person, to appreciate its futuristic look. That is mostly thanks to the honeycomb design on top of the speaker grill at the front of the speaker. On top of that, the polygonal-shaped buttons located at the top of the speaker add to the futuristic look. Overall, the design of the speaker is on-point, and nothing like anything seen on other Bluetooth speakers on the market. It doesn't end there - the build quality of the speaker is as solid as it looks. Its matte plastic (soft-touch plastic) construction all around allows the speaker to not draw fingerprints and scratches, and allows the speaker to feel very well-built and sturdy. I don't see this speaker falling apart anytime soon.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - 10/10<br />With this speaker, I was able to get around 8 hours of music playback time, which falls short of the promised 10 hours of music playback time. However, don't get me wrong here - 8 hours of music playback time is PHENOMENAL compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range. 8 hours. Of straight music-playing. Trust me, you won't have any complaints with the battery life of this speaker.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 9.5/10<br />At first when I got this speaker, the sound quality was almost mediocre - the overall sound was muffled, and it was horrible. But then when I used this speaker for about 2 hours or so, and let the speakers \\""burn-in\\"", the sound got much clearer. It got clearer to the point where its sound quality is one of the best in its class - well-balanced mids, highs, and lows, as well as just enough bass for my taste. The bass IS a bit overpowering, but I personally like that sort of sound. Vocals and instrumentals are quite clear, nothing crazy, but for a Bluetooth speaker of this price range, it's fantastic.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - 10/10<br />Just like any other Bluetooth speaker and any other device in today's market, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB. The standard stuff, and it works fine, so no complaints there. There's also an AUX port, in case your device's Bluetooth doesn't work, or your device simply doesn't have Bluetooth. Finally, the speaker also comes with a TF (Micro SD Card) slot, allowing you to play music on the speaker WITHOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE! This is quite fantastic in my opinion, as you can just carry around this speaker (with a Micro SD Card, of course), jamming to your favorite tune. Overall, the functionality of this speaker is great.<br /><br />VERDICT/OVERALL EXPERIENCE - 10/10<br />Overall, I really can't find much to complain about this speaker. From its build quality, battery life, sound quality, and functionality, the speaker excels in every single aspect. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a mid-range Bluetooth speaker that sounds better than a low-range speaker, or even your phone's speaker.arket, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB.

After having to slit the new contact flex to spread it out, I got  the unit to work with the touch screen, then due to the stress on the contacts being pulled sideways the copper traces in the new flex to the touch screen fractured internally when closing up the unit... after an hour of futzing around I gave up... wasted money!  If the contacts had been correct it would have been a piece of cake.  BTW, I have been fixing broken electronics for 50 years... I'm not a novice.",1438956394,208.231.30.245,0,09-08-2015

However, the vendor is super-fast and DHL managed to get it from the warehouse in China on a Friday morning to my doorstep in Florida by Monday afternoon - very good first impression, and major props to DHL as the shipper!<br /><br />Installation in my wife's 2014 Jetta SE was easy, and the longest part of the job was tucking the USB cable for the (optional) front DVR camera into the headliner. I would recommend using one of the trim tool kit's from Amazon, such as this one http://www.amazon.com/KINGLAKE�-Panel-Removal-Radio-Installer/dp/B00HNMLQAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1438978963&sr=8-3&keywords=car+stereo+trim+tool which helps getting the USB cable under the headliner without any drama.<br /><br />The Joying web site said only SD/TF cards up to 32Gb, but I filled a 128Gb card with MP3, AAC, and FLAC songs and plugged it into the SD slot and then powered the head-unit on. The first start-up took about 45 seconds, and I was a little worried that it would take that long each time I started the car, but subsequent starts were around 20 seconds. Would be nice if it was a bit faster, but not too bad a delay.<br /><br />A little later I found a configuration setting that let's you set a sleep delay from 5 minutes, up to a few hours. What this does is put the head-unit in a sleep mode, but keeps it powered on for a quick restart of around 5 seconds. I set it to 15 minutes, and it's super nice when you are stopping and starting your car multiple times during the day - get back in and turn the ignition on within the 15 minute timer and the music is pumping within seconds. Since these head-units use a decent amount of power, I don't think I'd leave it in this mode for more that 15 or 30 minutes as it will cause some additional drain on your battery in this mode.<br /><br />So how did I like the operation of the head-unit?  The GPS software is nice, and after 15 years with stand-alone Garmin units, the IGO software is a nice change. The radio app supports RDS, and has 18 presets you can set manually, or press the magnifying glass icon to have it automatically set the first 18 stations it finds. Reception seems good, and it gets the same stations the VW RCD310 radio was picking up in my driveway.<br /><br />The Video app found a couple of MP4 video files on the SD card, and plays them as you would expect. I found the movies to be a little dark but that was mid-day in the Florida sun. Checking again in the evening, and they looked great.<br /><br />The Music app works, but could do with some improvements. It takes about 30 seconds to scan all the songs on my 128Gb SD card before it starts playing them. Unfortunately it rescans the SD card every time you turn the car on, so that was a pain. Took a few minutes to login to my Google account, and through Google Play was able to download the PowerAmp music player. Problem solved!  It saves the last song played and starts with that song the next time the car is started. Double bonus is that it can be configured to NOT rescan the SD and USB storage devices, so it's ready to go within a few seconds.<br /><br />I plugged an older iPod Classic into one of the USB cables Joying provide, but nothing happened. With the Pioneer unit in my car the music player detects the iPod and presents the contents of the iPod in the same format as SD files. With the Joying I couldn't get the iPod to work at all, so I emailed their support staff to get their help. First thing the next morning I had an email telling me the iPod needed a special cable that could be ordered from their web site, so I ordered one. When it arrived I saw that it had a 16-pin block connector on one end that needed to be plugged in to the motherboard inside the head-unit. Ten minutes to remove the head0unit from the dashboard, 5 minutes to find a small screwdriver, 2 minutes to open the case, 1 minute to plug the new cable it, 2 minutes to close up the case, and 5 minutes to put it all back into the dash - a bit annoying as I would have ordered the 'special cable' at the same time as head-unit if I had known that it was required.<br /><br />After enabling the iPod support in the configuration settings, and starting the iPod application it still did not work. The Joying head-unit displayed the name of my iPod but never displayed any of the songs or playlists on it. I should mention this is a modified iPod Classic and has 128Gb of flash memory. Plugging in a newer iPod Touch worked fine, so it probably does not like the older operating system on the Classic.<br /><br />The Car Recorder application is cool, and records video from the front-facing camera I installed. The camera itself is a basic unit, and the Car Recorder app also worked with a Logitech C920 camera I tested it with. It saves the video in compressed format onto the SD card in the GPS slot, and this is not configurable so I replaced the Joying supplied 8Gb card with a 64Gb Class-10 Samsung card. With 4 gigs for the GPS software there is lots of space for recording your trips, or just day to day driving. Using the File Explorer application I could see that there were multiple MP4 files and LOG files with the same name. The  LOG files contain the GPS coordinates and date & time information, and looking at the video's for playback in the Car Recorder app overlays that metadata onto the MP4 video being shown, but it will not be present if you just copy the MP4 file of the GPS card and give it to someone in the event of a proble - always give them the LOG file that matches the MP4 file.<br /><br />My one real annoyance is the Bluetooth app while streaming music from my phone - music comes through fine, and the forward and back controls do what you expect but there is no song title or artist information. Looks like they have a little work to do getting that displayed.<br /><br />I don't have any 3G / 4G  USB devices to test internet access with, but it connects to my home WiFi while in the driveway, and it also connects to my iPhone running as a personal hotspot if you want Spotify, Wave or other services that require internet access. Looking at the User Guide I see the head-unit can function as a wireless hotspot itself, so I'm assuming that only works with a 3G or 4G-USB device.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice unit with a couple of minor irritants. Since I bought it there has been an upgrade that I applied, and it looks like the Joying folks will continue to release updated code for these head-units. Very happy with this purchase!",1438890040,201.179.243.199,1,09-08-2015

The bottom portion of the speaker has a slight angle to it, giving you more control over sound direction than most speakers in this market segment. Between the top and bottom areas of the speaker is a thin light band that glows (or blinks) blue or red depending on the speaker's connection or pairing status. While the design looks great and is very stylish, it's bright enough that it would probably be distracting if you wanted to listen to this speaker in a dark room.<br /><br />The individual raised buttons look good. While their wood grain pattern is slightly different than the rest of the speaker, it blends nicely and subtly sets the buttons apart. They all have raised symbols on them denoting their functions. My only gripe with them is that the Volume Up button is on the left and the Volume Down button is on the right, which is opposite of most speakers I've used or seen.<br /><br />The speaker volume has a nice range. I listened to a variety of music with it, though my favorite testing track is Sam Robson's \\""I Need Thee Every Hour\\"" from his YouTube channel (look him up!). It sounded beautiful through the speaker, and the volume was able to get plenty loud. The on-device volume setting is independent of your phone/tablet/etc's bluetooth volume setting, so make sure you haven't turned one of the two down by accident if you find the speaker won't get loud. While I couldn't find information on what version of Bluetooth this speaker uses, I suspect it's Bluetooth 4.0 as I didn't notice any discernible lag between the video on my Galaxy Note 4 and the audio coming out of the speaker.<br /><br />I really like how the speaker uses different status tones for things like Power On, Bluetooth Paired, and Max Volume. A lot of other speakers use spoken words instead of tones, and usually they just come out sounding like very poorly pronounced or broken English, and it gives the speaker a cheap feel. My only gripe with the status tones is the Power On tone ... it is ALWAYS loud no matter where you have the volume set when you turned the speaker off, and it often startles me. Overall, though, it's not a deal-breaker by any means.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this speakers sound, looks, and especially its slightly tilted design and status-light ring; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a portable single-driver Bluetooth speaker based off its performance. It's aesthetics are just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Review disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for the purposes of examination and review.

I have an armored rubber case on my iPad Air 1 (wifi model), after a short drop out of a Logitech keyboard shattered my previous device.  I still use the keyboard, but require a small folding easel to prop up the screen.<br /><br />Bottom line, the iPad w/armored case has enough room, but the rubberized texture makes for slow loading and unloading. Once that's all the way into this case, I can carefully slide the keyboard in also, but it's not any where close to &#34;roomy&#34;.<br /><br />As to the 4 stars, I'm not yet sold on the quality of this case. The plastic zipper tabs feel like they won't last, and the zipper itself has me being very careful.  I like how widely it opens, and the useful outside pouch, which holds my Mifi and dust cloth, but not the easel :(<br /><br />Overall I think this is a solid value for the price, especially if you are using a slim cover/lid for your iPad.",1438720422,208.150.167.104,1,06-08-2015

I would recommend spending those few extra $s and buying an iPod Nano from Apple. That being said, my three-star review is directed firmly at Apple and the 7th gen Nano itself...<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly (as Jony Ive would no doubt tell you) a wonderful, magical device and a miracle of modern engineering. The 7th gen's internal amp is a slight step up from that of the 6th gen Nano with a cleaner sound and marginally quieter noise floor, although I still prefer the size (and clip) of the 6th gen model. Here's why the 7th gen Nano only gets three stars from me. For a dedicated DAP that does basically nothing but play music and has no internet-connection capabilities of any kind, 16 Gb storage is pathetic and paltry. (Technically, it can play video too, but with the tiny screen and tiny amount of storage, I'm not sure why Apple even bothered with this capability.) After waiting three years for a refresh of this product, what do we get? Improved internals? More storage? At least the OPTION to pay lots of extra $$$$s for more storage? Nope. We get new colors. That's right -the opportunity to buy the exact same thing, but in a slightly different color.  Come on Apple. Get your act together.",1438632746,200.88.190.101,1,06-08-2015

I recommend keeping the supplying music device's volume at about 75% or lower and use the speaker to control the volume. It packs a punch and there is very little distortion even at high volume. It's not the smallest unit out there but I think the better bass and more crisp sound is aided by the shape and size of this unit.

29541243,1536,B00OZGI5T8,766810694,VGC VR-6600PRO-A 50 Watts Dual Band Mobile Ham Radio (This Item Not Include BTG-6600A1),Mobile_Electronics,4,10,11,N,N,"First impressions:<br /><br />This is not a radio for new users to start with.  I may be spoilt from simple mono banders and the simple & basic programming the Baofengs with CHIRP, but programming the VR-6600Pro manually is a chore.<br /><br />But once you have it programmed it is easy to use and a powerful rig.  I would just not recommend it to a novice user who is just starting out in radio.  Once I had the radio programmed it was a piece of cake for my daughter to operate the radio, but difficult for me to remember the steps to make changes.  I would find myself having to scroll through bands via the [B] key a lot if wanted to toggle from VHF to UHF and back to VHF, because there is no backwards with the [B]. One Press to go from VHF to 220Mhz, another press to skip the 300Mhz band , then 6 more presses to go back to VHF, as you have toggle through the extra bands.  Even when you disable the wide RX coverage, you still have Line In, AM and FM bands to toggle through.  I have sent a feature request into VGC to see about getting Line In, AM and FM moved into the expanded section.  I would like to just have 144, 220 & 440 on my mobile rig!<br /><br />While not a lab grade test, Amelia and I were able to have a QSO in simplex VHF from our house to a ham in Tracy 39 miles away as the crow flies with 50 watts.  All our on air reports have been favorable, nothing out of the ordinary either pro or con.  So no objections to on air performance at all.<br /><br /> My theories on the overall feature set and radio operation are the following:<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is a land mobile radio company where features, adjustability and flexibility are king.  The radios will be programmed by a technician, who has time to study and configure the radio for a semi static operation.  The average business will not reprogram frequencies often and will mostly just use the memory function.  This leads to a lot of advance features, but less focus on simpler operations, programing ease and the User Interface/Experience.<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is innovating with the APRS features, but again, it is deep in the feature set and not a novice grade set up.<br /><br />* When I sent in a feature request that would make manual programming easier for hams, the factory politely vetoed my suggestion to retain maximum flexibility.  I think this is due to the land mobile vision.<br /><br />APRS Setup<br /><br />I have the APRS module ready to set up, I downloaded APRSdroid for my Android phone, I sent off and got a passcode, but have not had time to set up APRS on the radio. I will get the APRS function set up as soon as I mount the radio.<br /><br /> Quick Reference<br /><br />There are a couple short cuts and quick references I will be setting up for the radio.  Little things that can make a hams life easier.  Keep an eye out on the VR6600 Facebook page.",1438677908,210.105.65.65,1,05-08-2015

You will need the reviews on Amazon because documentation is somewhere between minimal and nonexistent.<br />A couple of comments:<br />There are buttons that I have no idea what they do. One I accidentally pushed caused a lock icon to appear briefly, so I have to assume that it locks that file for later viewing. I have no idea which button that is nor was I able to replicate the behavior.<br />When you�re changing the language note that you cannot get into the menu if the device is plugged in. The menu only appears when powered by battery. You hit �menu� twice because the first push takes you to settings and the second push moves you to the menu tab with language options. Other reviews diagram what to look for in the default Russian for changing the language.<br />If you use a zip-tie to connect it to your rear view mirror you then don't have to worry about it coming disconnected on hot days. Carefully place so that it does not prevent you putting your mirror in night mode.<br />If the device keeps shutting itself off it likely has one of two problems:<br />If the light is red, it's losing power and the battery is not sufficient to run it without available power. Check your power cord and reseat it until the red light goes out and turns pink or blue (pink = charging, blue=charged).<br />If the light is not red but it repeatedly shuts off, take out the MicroSD card and format it on your computer. Although it overwrites old data, deleted files may still be enough to make the device think there is no storage available. Once you format it�ll work again.<br />As noted in other reviews, a class-4 MicroSD of no more than 16 GB is required. You can use a larger card, but it will not overwrite.<br />The camera is not locked into position, it moves around a bit, but if your cord is not pulling on it, it will generally hang flat.<br />The cord is extra long so that you can run it under the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet. Note that it is not long enough if your power is not on the dash. Mine is in the hatch under my elbow and it's about 12 inches too short to go along the front window, down the A pillar, under the dash, and then back to the hatch where my power ports reside.<br />Generally a decent starter camera.

I had to go back and hook them up the way i didnt want to just to make em sound good .. ! Video quality is ok thoi guess !,1438655025,199.5.207.165,0,05-08-2015

Video Review ?<br /><br />?? Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:<br /><br />1? Easy install. Took less than 4 minutes.<br />2? Requires a micro SD card. I used this one: [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Old Version]]]. It works perfectly.<br />3? Reason for the 3 stars: when attempting to press the menu button, it takes quite a while to activate. (we're talking a frustrating long time...) There are simply other dash cams out there in the same price range that work.<br />4? Delay shut-off time.  I like this feature, and it shows up here and there in other dash cams as well. This features allows the camera to continue recording for 30-ish seconds after you shut off the power (your car).  Smart idea since accidents can still happen if your is at a stand-still with the ignition off.<br />5? Video files: It records to AVI files that play natively on a Mac. This is nice because other dash cams I've tested record to a weird codec (still AVI video though) and have to be converted prior to playing.  If you can't play the video files, use VLC Player (free download).<br /><br />If you're curious every 60 seconds of footage uses about 200mbs of memory.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />? Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />- No, not really. There are other more reliable options out there in the same price range",1438641938,201.72.30.173,0,05-08-2015

It was a Pioneer AVH-X5700BHS for my 2010 Ford F150.  I wanted to be able to play videos for my kids on long trips but have a NAV and backup camera.  I didn't want to spend a large amount on headrest monitors nor did I want to install a over head DVD console.<br /><br />I came across the DITOP TFT LCD monitors by mistake for $19.99 each and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />When they arrived I was quite impressed by them.  The came with a bracket plate that you can use to cut and install in your headrest yourselves and there is also a bracket included that will allow you to install it on flat surfaces.<br /><br />I did not want to cut my headrests out just in case they were to be bad.  I also didn't want to mount them to a flat surface.  Then I remembered I purchased some headrest mounts for our iPad/Android tablets because I didn't want to buy a DVD player.  After looking at the headrest brackets that came with the DITOP LCD monitors and the tablet mounts I decided to modify the tablet mount to receive the DITOP LCD bracket.<br /><br />I removed the bracket plate and ran the wiring down the opening around my headrest posts to one central location under a seat.  The instructions for the LCD lack installation instructions.  They only go over the buttons on the screen and the remote.<br /><br />The wiring comes with a red/fused line, blue, and black.  I believe that the red line is constant and the blue is switched.  The black was obviously ground.  I ended up putting the red/blue together and connecting them to a 12v plug that I could manually plug in and out because they are constantly on in standby.<br /><br />After about an hour install of running lines and carefully placing them inside and under the seats I was finally able to test them.<br /><br />I was amazed of the quality they showed.  I think these would make a great addition to any vehicle.  I recommend them.  I included installation pictures.es.",1438484010,222.227.147.201,1,04-08-2015

38125790,1624,B00X5WRB5W,911677596,Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS Unisex Sports Fitness Watch Black 010-00863-00,Mobile_Electronics,5,2,2,N,N,"i have had this watch for about 3 months now. i have never owned any other type of gps enable watch before this one. however, my father owns the forerunner 305 and my mother has the forerunner 405 so i do still have some experience with those watches as well. in my opinion this is the best watch of the group hands down. the watch literally feels like a standard stopwatch. no extra weight, no extra bulk. the 405 does not quite fit like a normal watch due to the antenna extending down into the wrist strap. this watch is extremely comfortable to wear at all times and very adjustable in size (the holes go around the entire strap). this watch is very basic for runners and thus lacks the extra bells and whistles that the 305 and 405 have such as &#34;ghost&#34; trainers and &#34;breadcrumb&#34; directions. however this watch gives you current pace (more in just a moment), distance, calories, time, heart rate, and chimes at each &#34;lap.&#34; for a standard running regimen this watch is more than enough to supplement a good, hard workout.<br /><br />CURRENT PACE EXPLANATION<br />-i have noticed a lot of confusion about the idea of this watch lacking current &#34;real-time&#34; pace. However, to be quite honest, &#34;real time&#34; pace on a gps watch is pretty useless. the gps in the watch is NOT hooked up to a satellite CONTINUOUSLY. no gps in the world has this capability. instead, each gps has a certain &#34;ping&#34; time to send and receive a signal from a satellite. more advanced gps systems have quicker &#34;pings&#34; to more closely mimic a continuous connection but the connection is still never actually continuous. on watches that advertise &#34;current pace,&#34; the watch is simply showing you the exact speed at which you were going between the last two pings. basically the watch calculates the distance traveled between each ping and then uses the time it took you to go that distance to get a speed. this leaves a lot of room for random spikes and troughs in the data. no human can run at a single speed across a certain distance. the human body simply cannot set itself to &#34;cruise&#34; and go from there. thus a &#34;real time&#34; pace is fairly useless for a runner. let me give an example. if someone were to turn on their forerunner 405 and set it to show current pace and run for 20 seconds at an 8:00min/mi pace, assuming the watch has a ping every 2 seconds or so, the data would look something like this: 6:52, 7:20, 8:15,7:47, 8:30, 6:59, 8:02, 8:10, etc...obviously this data is not really constant with an 8:00min/mi pace however the person may still very well be able to hit EXACTLY an 8:00min mile. What the forerunner 110 does, rather than show the data from EACH ping, is it takes each ping and adds it to a list with every other ping that has been recorded across the time frame and averages them all together. the final number that is shown on your watch will thus be called the &#34;current AVERAGE pace.&#34; which in all honesty is MUCH more useful if one is trying to hit a certain pace goal. basically this current average pace can quite accurately depict your mile split well before you've reached the mile marker..if you speed up significantly then the ping data will thus be in a lower range and bring your &#34;average&#34; time down. now some of you might think that this means that the watch only displays a pace that doesnt refresh very often. however, the exact opposite is true. the watch will refresh the current average pace every time another ping comes in..so basically your current average pace could hypothetically move up or down with every single ping. but due to the beauty of the AVERAGE, the watch will not jump around sporadically like in a &#34;current pace&#34; but rather stay around a certain time and gradually move up or down according to your speed. in essence, the &#34;current pace&#34; on a lot of gps watches is really truly useless and most people will never end up using it because it doesnt actuallygive you any solid data to work off of. because the data is changing so dramatically each second, the data is just plain useless. FYI: some runners may have noticed very random spikes in their &#34;fastest&#34; pace that the garmin software will show after uploading the data. basically, &#34;fastest pace&#34; during your run means that for one single ping during the run you might have run a 5:34min/mile pace for all of 1 second. however, because that pace is still part of the data that is added into the overall time, it still counts as your &#34;fastest pace&#34; for the run even though your average mile pace for the workout was only 8:34...<br /><br />another nice thing about this watch is that after each run is saved to the history on the watch, it can be accessed to show the average pace over the entire distance rather than just the mile splits. the mile splits for older runs can only be accessed and viewed once the watch is connected to a computer and the data is uploaded.<br /><br />hope all of this has cleared up any confusion about current average pace for the forerunner 110!",1438496544,193.197.63.106,1,04-08-2015

It's loud, clear, and there's a decent amount of bass. However, don't be expecting anything room shattering; it's got just enough 'thump' to have a balanced sound.<br /><br />Really, though, the quality of sound this thing puts out is just impressive. I sat it side by side with my 130$ Creative Sound Blaster AXX 200, and it was going toe to toe. I honestly think, at the end of the day, the Sentey sounds better. It just has a 'fuller' sound to me. The Creative arguably has clearer highs and mids, but the Sentey's got it beat in bass. And overall, it just sounds less 'tinny' than the Creative.<br /><br />GREAT bang for your buck at its current price. This speaker sounds like it should at least cost 50 or 60$. It's a great buy for a budget bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />I've been investigating Sentey more and more lately after seeing how many products they have on Amazon and all the great reviews they've been getting. Apparently they are a US founded company, which is awesome. However, when perusing their website, I see a lot of grammatical and spelling errors common in foreign hired help. Whether they outsource their media building or not, that is somewhat concerning coming from a company claiming to reside in Florida. Who knows... maybe they are a bunch of American orientals?? Lol<br /><br />Still, the quality of this speaker is on par for what you pay. It's solid. Feels durable. It's quite hefty in the hand, and has a nice rubber finish for a good grip on the outside. The buttons are large and easy to see and are touch sensitive.<br /><br />Overall... a great buy! This thing puts out more sound than it should!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it for it's current price (33$).",1438429987,223.194.27.104,1,03-08-2015

I find it to have a strong mounting, with endless adjustments, and to be suitable for a wide range of tablets.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a coupon that covered the cost of this product, so that I could review it. I did order it from Amazon.<br /><br />The device clips onto one side of the headrest pole (as seen on the product page). The designers have done an excellent job in making this a \\""universal\\"" mount. I found that based on my measurements, it will fit any tablet with a height of 5.5 inches up to 8 inches. This would be measured at the narrowest part of the tablet. The arms that hold the tablet have a spring control to hold snugly and yet release easily as well, while the main section extends and then locks into place. There are rubberized pads on top and bottom. The device has knobs for all places that tighten, so it is really easy to mount and adjust. I was worried when I saw the design that it might not hold the tablet well, but in fact it does fine. At first, the poles at the top went over the power button on my Android tablet, but even the top feet can be moved, so it worked out. I am impressed by the ingenuity that went into this unit - well done!<br /><br />There are a couple of things to consider when ordering. You must have bare support poles for this to work, and the poles need to be straight, not curved. So if you are a short person, this would not work on your seat because the headrest would be snug against the seat. Mine had a small bend on both sides, but there was still enough straight pole for the mount to work. Also, the headrest needs to be at least 2 inches above the seat back. In my case, the head rest was just barely high enough above the seat so that the tightening knob would still work. Do the measurements before you order to make sure your car will work: straight support poles, with the head rest at least 2 inches above the seat.<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended..<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended.",1438297999,199.193.109.197,1,02-08-2015

I had purchased a different type before buying this one but I didn't realize the other style was for the sports bands that lay flat. I have the melanise loop which will not lay flat. This raised option is perfect. There is only one con I've found with this product and that is that they added an indent for the cord to go but it will not stay because of the length of the connecting piece to the battery charger. For me that's not a deal breaker. But for those who must have the cord tucked away you may need to pull out a drill and angle the hole differently at the top to make it work or find some decorative tape to embellish and hide it. It's a handsome and sleek. I anticipated it to look cheap but I was pleasantly surprised. It also has a decent weight where it won't move or turn over easily.,1438296196,217.47.63.2,1,02-08-2015

Well actually, &#34;we&#34; don't misplace things, it's some &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; that moves them someplace else from were &#34;we&#34; put them. :)  Nice loud sound from the receivers and the flashing led is easy to see in dim light.  The flashlight on the transmitter is neat and provides a pretty good beam.  Receivers are nicely constructed and have thick support around the ring hole, was able to use a larger ring than the tiny ones supplied.  Broadcast distance was very/very good.  Tested by letting wife hide a receiver.  I started downstairs, other side of house, with receiver &#34;hidden&#34; in a desk drawer upstairs on the far side of the house. Approx. distance 20 meters through maybe 3 interior walls. I could not hear the 'beep' but my wife said 'it' beeped.  In wandering around until I finally heard it.  Didn't take too much to finally narrow a possible room location.  My ears might not give an exact location of where the sound came from but I knew it had to in there somewhere. Just simply started opening drawers and pressing the button.  Found it!!  Total time: about 5-6 minutes whereas I've spent what seemed like hours retracing steps and tearing apart the house looking. Cons: If receiver is laying totally flat, colour up, the sound is muffled because the speaker is on the back.  Wish there was a 'replacement face' or overlay for the transmitter to write down what each colour ID was assigned to.  Heck, if I can't remember where something is at,  HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME to remember what each colour represents???  Is that expecting too much from me? ;) ;)  [I know, I know - tape a cheat sheet on the back of the transmitter.] Problem not encountered yet:  How do I find the transmitter if that darn &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; hides it on me?

No this isn't going to perform as well as a $450 dollar unit and shouldn't be expected to.<br />But this seems to do the job well enough.<br /><br />I recently used this on work trip, and for the first time in my life, i wanted to see a cop and despite the 150 miles one way trip THERE WAS 1 COP total there and back. lol. This did give me a warning, however, as with all radar detectors, the issue is, for me at least, i like to have my music, relatively loud,and therefor cannot hear any sort of radar detector. The normal solution to this is the light up display, however when i am on unfamiliar roads with people who apparently got their license back when they were just giving them away.... (Yea im talking about most of the people that drive the 495 beltway) The last thing i would do would be to look down frequently to check the radar detector.<br /><br />So in my 300 mile testing, i found that highway mode worked reasonably well, with the occasion &#34;false&#34; alarm. I say false in quotations because i fully believe it picked up some signal from the k band, it just wasn't a warning i cared about. Many programmable road signs, will send an alert for instance.<br /><br />Best i can tell this detects h,x,k,KA,Str La bands. What any of them are i have no clue though the road signs that triggered alerts were all on the K band.<br /><br />However in city mode i surprised that this did not go bananas as they used to when close to a stores theft detection tag sensors at the door.<br /><br />The unit comes with a clear gel grip pad to help hold the unit in place, a car adapter that features an on and off button, instructions in both russian and english, and of course the radar detector.<br /><br />It is nice and low profile so it wasnt so blatantly obvious it was there despite sitting in the middle of my dash. The unit features a nice small display that shows what band it is detecting as well as the signal strength to help you gauge distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.<br /><br />The speaking, if i caught it correctly said&#34; position ahead&#34; in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)<br /><br />I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.<br /><br />Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review. MY ratings never remotely consider that factor, I rely to much on reviews from time to time when buying products to give something a positive rating because its free. However I  do consider the list price on amazon for some items to keep it all in context.

It allows you to see all the data this little camera makes available and excellent features allow you to quickly find and export the specific clip you're looking for. This camera also has a microphone built in, but you need to enable it in the settings. The audio quality really isn't that good, but it's better than nothing. It sounds like it's underwater. The video quality is quite good. I also like that it has a built-in battery, so it can continue recording for a little while (configurable), even after you shut off the engine.

It was the only reasonable BT transmitter with digital/Toslink input which I needed to convert a TV's output to a BT signal (the TV, a Toshiba, does not have analog audio output, as odd as that seems). When I first tried to buy this item (the Andoer), Amazon said the soonest it would arrive was after I was to leave for the weekend (where the device was to be installed as part of a gift), for whatever reasons 2 day or 1 day prime shipping wasn't available.<br /><br />So I bought the seemingly identical item branded as &#34;LingsFire&#34; (at $5 more) because 2 day shipping was an option for that item. That unit arrived in 2 days (a day before leaving for the weekend), but the power supply didn't work (it put out 1.7V instead of the required 5V) and the device/box itself never powered-on even when used with a verified good power supply. So I started the return/refund process for that product (which perhaps coincidentally, appeared to have been previously opened and re-sealed/taped).<br /><br />I then searched again on Amazon and now free 1-day shipping was available for the Andoer-branded version of this device! So I purchased it and crossed my fingers. It arrived at 6pm the following day and we made the boat for our weekend trip where the device was to be installed along with a JBL Flip 2 speaker for my hard-of-hearing father to watch/hear the television without bothering everyone else in the house.<br /><br />I tested the new (Andoer) power-supply (it put out 5v) and device/unit quickly (the blue LED came on and blinked) and then packed it up along with the BT speaker for our trip.<br /><br />PAIRING:<br />I read the directions for both devices, but could not get them to pair. I sat and stared and read and re-read and tried different BT speakers. Finally, I decided to hold down the power button for like 10 seconds and finally the LED flashed quickly alternating between red and blue. *This* is the pairing mode. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode. Anyway, once I discovered this, it was smooth-sailing and everyone is very happy.<br /><br />I do wish there was less lag/latency however: there's really no way, at least with this TV, to eliminate the delay between the audio coming out of the TV's built-in speakers and those coming from the BT speaker. So we just disable or turn-down the TV's speakers, but that may not be an option for everyone.de. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode.

It didn't support all the accessibility options than Android KitKat devices are supposed to support, like disabling unwanted touchscreen gestures.  After 26 days, it stopped working.

I can't get a clear answer, and I can't file a rma request while the website's broken, but I think they want me to ship this to Eindhoven for repairs, and pay them to ship it back.
